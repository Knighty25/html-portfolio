<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Olga. I love learning new things. I love a challenge. I adore travel and exploring new places and meeting new people. Lives can be so different and so interesting.  People, however are the same wherever I go. I have met incredible, warm and friendly people, the world over.

 <p>Learning to code has changed my life! Who knew solving problems could bring this much satisfaction? Who knew you really could work from a laptop, anywhere in the world?</p>
